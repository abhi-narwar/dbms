ðŸ”¹ What is a Transaction?
A transaction is a group of operations that work together as one unit.
It is used to perform a task in a database.
For example, if we transfer money from one account to another, we read the balance, subtract the amount, and update it â€” all these steps form one transaction.

ðŸ”¹ What are the operations in a transaction?
There are two main operations:

Read(A): This reads the value of A from the database and puts it in memory (buffer).

Write(A): This writes the updated value of A from memory (buffer) back to the database.

ðŸ”¹ What are the states of a transaction?
1. Active State
This is the first state.
The transaction is working and executing instructions.
Changes are stored in memory (not yet in database).

2. Partially Committed
The transaction has finished all instructions, but changes are still in memory.
Not saved to database yet.

3. Committed State
All changes are saved to the database.
Now the transaction is successful and completed.

4. Failed State
If any problem happens while executing, the transaction goes to failed state.
It cannot continue.

5. Aborted State
After failure, we undo all changes (called rollback).
Then it moves to aborted state. Nothing is saved.

6. Terminated State
This is the final state.
After commit or abort, the transaction ends completely.
