❓ What is Normalization?
🩵 Answer:
Normalization is a process in DBMS to make the database clean and consistent by:

Removing duplicate (repeated) data

Making sure data is correct using lossless decomposition


❓ What are Normal Forms?
🩵 Answer:
Normal Forms are the steps or levels of normalization. Each level reduces more problems.


 What is First Normal Form (1NF)?
🩵 Answer:
A table is in 1NF if:

Every column has only one value (called atomic value).

No columns have multiple values or sets.

✅ Example:
Wrong: Subjects = {Math, English}
Correct: Subjects = Math (in a separate row) and Subjects = English (another row)


❓ What is Second Normal Form (2NF)?
🩵 Answer:
A table is in 2NF if:

It is already in 1NF

There is no partial dependency (non-prime attribute depends on only a part of the primary key)

📝 Partial Dependency: When only part of a composite key determines a non-key attribute


❓ What is Third Normal Form (3NF)?
🩵 Answer:
A table is in 3NF if:

It is already in 2NF

There is no transitive dependency (non-key depends on another non-key)

📝 Transitive Dependency: A → B → C
If A determines B and B determines C, then A indirectly determines C, which is not allowed in 3NF for non-prime attributes.





❓ What is Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)?
🩵 Answer:
A table is in BCNF if:

It is already in 3NF

For every functional dependency A → B, A must be a super key.

✅ BCNF is a stronger version of 3NF.
