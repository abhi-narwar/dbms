❓ What is a Strong Entity Set?
Answer:
A strong entity set has enough attributes to identify each entity uniquely.
It has a primary key (main identifier).
In ER diagrams, the primary key is shown by underlining the attribute.

❓ What is a Weak Entity Set?
Answer:
A weak entity set does not have enough attributes to identify entities uniquely.
It has no primary key by itself.
Instead, it uses a partial key called a discriminator to identify entities within the weak set.
The discriminator is shown by underlining with a dashed line.

❓ What is a Relationship?
Answer:
A relationship is a connection or association between two or more entities.

❓ What is a Unary Relationship Set?
Answer:
Unary relationship involves only one entity set in the relationship.
Example: An employee supervises another employee (same entity set).


❓ What is a Binary Relationship Set?
Answer:
Binary relationship involves two different entity sets.
Example: A student enrolls in a course (student and course are two entity sets).



❓ What is a Ternary Relationship Set?

Ternary relationship involves three entity sets participating together.
Example: A doctor prescribes medicine to a patient at a hospital (doctor, patient, hospital).


❓ What is an N-ary Relationship Set?
Answer:
N-ary relationship involves ‘n’ number of entity sets in a relationship.
It is a general case for more than two or three entities.
