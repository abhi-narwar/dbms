❓ What is Functional Dependency?
Answer:
Functional dependency means if two rows have the same value for one attribute, they must also have the same value for another.
For example, if Roll_No → Name, then same roll number will always give same name.

❓ What is Trivial Functional Dependency?
Answer:
It’s called trivial when the right-hand side is already part of the left-hand side.
Example: Roll_No, Name → Name.


❓ What is Non-Trivial Functional Dependency?
Answer:
It’s non-trivial when the right-hand side has at least one attribute that’s not part of the left-hand side.
Example: Roll_No → Name (here, Name is not in Roll_No).

❓ What is Decomposition in DBMS?
🩵 Answer:
Decomposition means breaking one big table into two or more smaller tables.

❓ Why do we use Decomposition?
🩵 Answer:
To remove problems like redundancy and anomalies, and to make the database design better.


❓ What is Lossless Decomposition?
🩵 Answer:
It means no data is lost when we divide a table.
If we join the smaller tables again, we get the original table back.


❓ What is Dependency Preservation?
🩵 Answer:
It means all functional dependencies (rules) from the original table should still be true in the smaller tables.


❓ What is Lossless Join Decomposition?
🩵 Answer:
If we join the smaller tables using a natural join and get back the original table, it is called lossless join.


❓ What is Lossy Join Decomposition?
🩵 Answer:
If joining the smaller tables gives extra or wrong data and not the original table, then it is lossy join.
