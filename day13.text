âœ… File Structures in DBMS (Indexing)
Indexing is used to speed up data access. It reduces the time needed to find a record.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Primary Index
Built on the primary key of a file.

The data file is ordered by the primary key.

Index contains:

Primary Key value

Pointer to the block in the data file

ðŸ“˜ Example:
If data is sorted by Roll Number, the index will store:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[Roll No | Pointer]
ðŸ§  Formula:
Average block accesses = logâ‚‚(Bi) + 1
(Bi = number of index blocks)

ðŸ“Œ Fastest access if searching by primary key.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Clustering Index
Built on a non-key field (not unique).

The data file is physically ordered by this field.

Multiple records can have the same clustering field value.

ðŸ“˜ Example:
Index on Department in an Employee file (many employees in same dept)

ðŸ§  One entry in the index â†’ points to block containing all matching records.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Secondary Index
Built on any field (can be key or non-key).

Does not require data to be sorted.

Used when primary index already exists but access is needed on another field.

ðŸ“˜ Example:
If data is sorted by Roll No but we want fast access by Name, we use a secondary index.

ðŸ“Œ More flexible but slower than primary index.
