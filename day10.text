âœ… Interview Answer: What is a Schedule in DBMS?
A schedule is the order in which the operations (like read, write) of multiple transactions are executed.
It decides how transactions run in a system â€” one by one or at the same time.


ðŸ”¹ 1. Serial Schedule
In a serial schedule, one transaction runs completely, and only then the next one starts.
No mixing of operations.
This schedule is always:

Consistent (data remains correct)

Recoverable (we can fix it after failure)

Cascadeless (no side effects)

Strict (safe even during crashes)

ðŸ“Œ Example:
First, Transaction T1 runs fully. After that, T2 runs.




ðŸ”¹ 2. Non-Serial Schedule
In a non-serial schedule, transactions run together, and their operations are mixed.
This is done to save time and increase speed (concurrency).
But this schedule may not always be:

Consistent

Recoverable

Cascadeless

Strict

ðŸ“Œ Example:
Some operations from T1, then some from T2, then again from T1 â€” all mixed.



âœ… Summary Line:
So, schedules help manage how transactions run in a system, and serial schedules are always safe but slow, while non-serial ones are faster but need to be carefully managed.
