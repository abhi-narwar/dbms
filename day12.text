✅ Interview Answer: Relational Algebra (RA)
🔸 What is Relational Algebra?
Relational Algebra is a procedural query language used in databases.
It works on relations (tables) and gives relations as output.
It has operators to filter, join, or modify tables.


🔹 Basic Operators (Core)
1. σ (Selection)
Selects rows based on a condition.
📌 Think: Filter rows like WHERE in SQL.

📘 Example:
σ(age > 25)(Students) → All students with age > 25



2. ∏ (Projection)
Selects only certain columns from a table.
📌 Think: Pick columns like SELECT name, age

📘 Example:
∏(name, age)(Students) → Only name and age columns


3. X (Cross Product)
Combines every row of R1 with every row of R2
📌 Returns m × n rows

📘 Example:
R1 has 2 rows, R2 has 3 → Result: 6 rows



4. U (Union)
Combines tuples from R1 and R2
📌 No duplicates. Schema must be same.

🟢 Max rows: m + n
🟡 Min rows: max(m, n)



5. − (Set Difference or Minus)
Returns rows in R1 that are not in R2

📘 Example:
R1 − R2 → Only unique rows of R1 not present in R2


6. ρ (Rename)
Renames a relation or its attributes.

📘 Example:
ρ(Students ← S) → Rename relation S to Students




🔹 Extended Operators (Joins & Advanced)
7. ∩ (Intersection)
Returns only common tuples in both R1 and R2
📌 Rows that appear in both tables

8. ⋈c (Conditional Join)
Cross product + Selection condition

📘 Example:
R ⋈ (R.id = S.id)
Combines only where R.id = S.id

9. ⋈ (Equi Join)
A Conditional Join with only = conditions

📘 Example:
Join where Dept.id = Employee.dept_id

10. ⋈ (Natural Join)
Joins on common attributes automatically
Removes duplicate columns

📌 If no common attribute → behaves like Cross Product

11. ⟕ (Left Outer Join)
Returns all rows of Left table (R)
If no match in Right (S), fills NULL

12. ⟖ (Right Outer Join)
Returns all rows of Right table (S)
If no match in Left (R), fills NULL

13. ⟗ (Full Outer Join)
Returns all rows from both tables
Fills NULL where there is no match

14. / (Division Operator)
Used in “for all” type queries
Returns those A-tuples that are related to all tuples in B

📘 Rule:
Attributes of B ⊂ Attributes of A
Result = A - B

📘 Example:
A: (student, subject)
B: (subject)
A / B → All students who have taken all subjects in B

✅ One-Line Summary for Viva/Interview:
Relational Algebra is a way to write queries using operations like select (σ), project (∏), join (⋈), and more, that work on relations and return relations.
