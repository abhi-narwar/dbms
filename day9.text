âœ… Interview Answer: What are ACID Properties?
ACID properties are four important rules that every transaction should follow to keep the database safe and correct.
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.


ðŸ”¹ 1. Atomicity
This means all or nothing.
A transaction should happen completely or not at all.
If one step fails, the whole transaction is cancelled.
Example: While transferring money, if debit happens but credit fails â€” that is not allowed. Both must happen or none.


ðŸ”¹ 2. Consistency
The database should always be correct before and after the transaction.
It should follow all the rules (called constraints).
Example: If a rule says balance cannot be negative, then after the transaction, that rule should still be true.


ðŸ”¹ 3. Isolation
Many transactions can happen at the same time, but they should not affect each other.
The final result should be the same as if the transactions ran one by one.
Example: If two people book the same train seat at the same time, only one should succeed.


ðŸ”¹ 4. Durability
After a transaction is completed, its result is saved permanently.
Even if there is a power failure or system crash, the data should not be lost.
It is stored safely in the database.

âœ… Summary (Optional Ending Line):
So, ACID properties help in making sure that all transactions are safe, correct, and reliable in a database system.
